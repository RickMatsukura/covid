    "This is a template for your DIY Covid Dashboard, to which you can add the code you developed in the previous notebooks. The dashboard will be displayed using [voila](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), a Python dashboarding tool that converts notebooks to standalone dashboards. Contrary to the other libraries we have seen, the ```voila``` package must be installed using *pip* or *conda* but it does not need to be imported - it rather acts at the level of the notebook server. Package ```voila``` is already installed on the QMUL JupyterHub as well as in the Binder - to install it locally, follow the [instructions](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html) online.\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly speaking, Voila acts by **running all the cells in your notebook** when the dashboard is first loaded; it then hides all code cells and displays all markdown cells and any outputs, including widgets. However, the code is still there in the background and handles any interaction with the widgets. To view this dashboard template rendered in Voila click [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fsmeraldi/diy-covid19dash/main?urlpath=%2Fvoila%2Frender%2FDashboard.ipynb)."

The instructions may seem a bit involved, but the actual steps are surprisingly easy - we will be going through them together during a live session.
